NUnitLite Version 0.7 - May 11, 2012

This release brings NUnitLite to a point where it is functionally 
equivalent to the NUnit 3.0 build of NUnitLite and has most of the 
same capabilities as the full version of NUnit. 

Obsolete methods and classes have been removed and the code has been
reorganized to facilitate code sharing with NUnit 3.0. 

NUnitLite is now built for the desktop using Visual Studio 2010. A VS 2008 project is still used for the compact framework builds.

Separate builds are now created for .NET 2.0, 3.5 and 4.0

A nuspec file is now provided and NUnitLite is distributed under NuGet.

New Features and Enhancements

* An An XML result file may be saved using the --result option of the runner.

* The --explore option will create a list of tests contained in the assembly.

* The --out option allows redirecting the final result to a report file. It must be used when running the test on a device without a Console. 

* Assume.That is now supported

* ExpectedExceptionAttribute now supports the same properties as for full NUnit.

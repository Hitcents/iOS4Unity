iOS4Unity - Native iOS APIs from C#
=========

iOS4Unity is a plugin that finally brings native iOS APIs to C# using only managed code -- with no Objective-C libraries involved! iOS4Unity takes advantage of the core C functions that comprise the building blocks of Objective-C to expose native iOS APIs to C#. iOS4Unity also provides native callbacks to C# without using UnitySendMessage that is completed supported under AOT!

- Native iAds - direct access to ADBannerView 
- UIView, UIWindow, and UIViewController - for working with native views 
- IAPs through StoreKit - for simplified in-app purchases 
- Setup third party Obj-C libraries for use from C# - bind libraries missing a Unity plugin!

iOS4Unity is a plugin that finally brings native iOS APIs to C# using only managed code -- with no Objective-C libraries involved! iOS4Unity takes advantage of the core C functions that comprise the building blocks of Objective-C to expose native iOS APIs to C#. iOS4Unity also provides native callbacks to C# without using UnitySendMessage that is completed supported under AOT!
<br>
APis include:
<br>
- UIAlertView and UIActionSheet - for displaying native popups
<br>
- UIApplication and NSNotificationCenter - for native notifications
<br>
- UIDevice, NSLocal, and UIScreen - for native iOS settings
<br>
- Native iAds - direct access to ADBannerView
<br>
- UIView, UIWindow, and UIViewController - for working with native views
<br>
- IAPs through StoreKit - for simplified in-app purchases
<br>
- Setup third party Obj-C libraries for use from C# - bind libraries missing a Unity plugin!
